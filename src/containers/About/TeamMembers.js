      "Looking back, my passion for massage began at a very young age. As an active child, I’d often get tightness in my back and pain in my knees and massage always helped melt away my aches and pains.",
      "Massage has always been a part of my life; as a student, throughout my running career, years working in the corporate world and as a mother. Through first-hand experience, I have always been an advocate for massage and its many benefits such as injury prevention, recovery, stress reduction and sleep management, just to name a few.",
      "Massage helped me in both my pregnancies to ease the symptoms as my body prepared for birth and to manage my wellbeing as I dealt with life as a new mom. It also allowed me form a bond with my children, sooth them to sleep, aid in their digestion and ease their discomfort during the teething stages.",
      "I’m grateful for this life of mine working within my community and with people of all ages and stages of their lives; from young athletes, pre and post natal moms and the aging population. It is always my pleasure to serve. I look forward to discussing your needs and creating an individualized treatment plan to help you meet your health and wellness goals.",
