        We like to bend the rules. We believe that you should cease every moment of YOU time as you navigate the busy, complicated, weird days of mama-hood. We call BS on mommy guilt and believe you must first care for yourself before you can properly care for those you love.

        “But I don’t have TIME?!” Although we would love YOU time to be at a beach while a handsome stranger feeds you macaroons simultaneously fanning you with a palm leaf.. we know that this isn’t always possible between feedings and daycare drop off… you know the drill mama. This is why we have decided to come to you. To see you in those little moments of time that you could have a massage but can’t quite arrange your schedule to leave the house. It is even covered under insurance so you can save your pennies to replace your favourite top baby just spit up on.

      We have helped 1000’s of mamas add the simple pleasure of massage back into their lives again and we hope to help you do the same.
