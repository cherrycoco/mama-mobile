          <h3>SARAH RENNICK</h3>
          <p>
            Sarah Rennick, RMT, founded Mama Mobile Massage after seeing a huge problem. After working for over 5 years at prenatal/postnatal clinics she noticed the challenges mothers faced in trying to schedule a massage on a regular basis.

            Towards the end of pregnancy mamas didnâ€™t want to worry about things like parking, winter weather or having to leave the house after work. Postnatal mamas struggled to plan their massage due to the demanding schedule of their new baby.

            Aside from her work as a Registered Massage Therapist Sarah is a birth doula, infant massage instructor, certified personal trainer and prenatal massage therapy expert. She has been featured on CTV, Rogers TV and in self care podcasts/live events catered to moms.
