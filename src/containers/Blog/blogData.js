The added weight can also lead to altered posture and biomechanics as we change the way we sleep, stand and move during pregnancy. As the baby grows and the uterus expands, the abdominal muscles also stretch and lose their ability to support as they once did. We provide safe pre-natal exercises to prepare the body for delivery and safe movement techniques to reduce stress on the muscles and joints. Treatments may include soft tissue therapy, instrument or gentle manual adjustments and kinesiology tape for any aches and pains. We have special pillows that allow you to lay on your stomach during treatment! (Just like us mama!)'

          'I‚Äôm a big proponent of self-care; mani-pedi‚Äôs, facials, long bubble baths and hair masks. But above all else, I LOVE getting a massage. While I was pregnant I would go for a bi-weekly massage and it was always the highlight of my week. However, once Lucas burst onto the scene I had a lot less time for self-care and making space in my schedule for a massage was no longer a priority. But the truth is I need massages now more than ever. Living in a townhouse and carting Lucas up and down multiple flights of stairs multiple times per day has taken its toll on my back, and now that I‚Äôm working out again my muscles are in a constant state of soreness. I was desperate to find a way to work massages back into my regular routine when I came across Mama Mobile Massage on Instagram.',
          'As the name suggests, Mama Mobile Massage offers pre and post-natal massage therapy services in the comfort of your own home. I booked my service during Lucas‚Äô afternoon nap hour. My RMT Sam showed up a little early to give me time to get Lucas down. As she set up in my living room, he settled into his crib, and by 3pm I was face down in mama massage heaven. Sam assured me that if Lucas woke up that we had more than enough time for me to go upstairs and get him back into nap mode. That‚Äôs the beauty about this company. They account for the unexpected (read: likely) by book ending the session with extra time.',
          'Sam communicated with me throughout the session, ensuring that the pressure was perfect. Deep enough to work out any issues, but gentle enough to relax me. Her spa-like music and soft as clouds sheets and pillows lulled me into a light sleep, and by the end of the session both Lucas and I were feeling well rested and relaxed AF.',
          'If you are looking for the perfect gift to give to that mama to be or new mom on your list (or yourself), this is it. As kids come into the picture it becomes so much harder to take time out of our busy schedules for ourselves, but an in-home massage service that respects and accounts for the element of surprise gave me a sense of relief and comfort, making for a much more relaxing experience. I‚Äôm not one for New Year Resolutions, but if I had to put just one on my list it would be to make more time for self-care in 2019, starting with more regular massages. And it doesn‚Äôt hurt that my benefits are about to renew üòâ',

I got a few massages in the year after Jacob was born, but it was often very stressful to schedule for the first 9 months or so since he was hard to predict and could be very fussy.',
          'I didn‚Äôt have Jacob running around during my massage this time but I made sure to ask about how that would work. The therapist let me know they schedule extra time around each massage so if you have to stop to nurse/soothe the baby you can still get your full massage length even if you have to take some little breaks. I am crossing my fingers my next little boy will be better at napping but it‚Äôs good to know they are very flexible like that.',
          'The prenatal massage itself was excellent. They set up a different prenatal massage pillow I haven‚Äôt used before. In the past when I‚Äôve had prenatal massages almost every place has you do side lying and there is a support pillow under your bump. The pillow they used lets you lie face down. It‚Äôs on an upwards angle with a cutout and sling where your belly is. You stomach stays supported by the sling so there is no back strain. It was nice to lie on my stomach ‚Äì something I haven‚Äôt done in a while! The therapist was great and obviously experienced with prenatal massage.',

As long as you are working with a Registered Massage Therapist and have a pillow which completely elevates/supports your belly in most cases you will be safe. Our two-part pillowing system is contoured to fit around your entire belly.`,

The top pillow is carved out to support tender breasts and contoured around the top of the belly completely elevating it from the table. Both of these pillows work together to support the mama to be on the Massage table. The beauty of having two separate pillows is that they can be moved closer together/apart to accommodate the size of the belly.
